# Host network model


Host network model:

- Provides the minimum level of network protection/abstraction.
- No isolation on this type of open containers, thus leave the container widely unprotected.
- Containers running in the host network stack should see a higher level of performance than those traversing the **docker0** bridge and iptables port mappings

## Prerequisites

Having completed lab **00 - Setup lab environment**

## Connect to Sunnyvale's Ubuntu VM

```console
$ cd <GIT_REPO_NAME>/vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@docker-vm:~$ 
```

## Test the **Host network model**

We run an **nginx** container with a host network, notice that we did not map any port with the `-p` flag.

```console
vagrant@docker-vm:~$ docker run \
    --rm \
    -d \
    -it \
    --net host \
    nginx 
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally

```

The command below will prove that the nginx container opened the 80 port directly on the host.

```console
vagrant@docker-vm:~$ curl http://localhost:80

This command would return an error in the case of bridge network.

Stop the running container.

```console
vagrant@docker-vm:~$ docker stop $(docker ps -q)
